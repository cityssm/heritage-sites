The Sault Ste. Marie Cenotaph stands in front of the Courthouse. Designed by Alfred Howell and unveiled in 1925, the monument is notable for its inscription composed by Rudyard Kipling for the city. The site was re-designed in 1992. Another monument in memory of "New Ontario's" dead in the Great War was placed at the top of Gore Street during the Soldiers' Reunion in 1923.
