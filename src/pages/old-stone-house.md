The story of the Ermatinger family weaves into Canada's history with regards to the early settlers, voyageurs, soldiers, writers, and artists. Prior to the completion of the transcontinental railway, Sault Ste. Marie was the gateway between the eastern settlement of Canada and the Western boundaries of exploration.

Charles Oakes Ermatinger was born in Montreal in 1776. He was of Swiss decent and was the son of the wealthy Lawrence Ermatinger and Jemima Oakes. Members of Charles' extended family had been involved in the fur trade and naturally he followed suit.
