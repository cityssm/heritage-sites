Built in 1812-1814 by fur trader Charles Oakes Ermatinger, the Old Stone House is the oldest house northwest of Toronto. For many years it was the centre of social and business life in Sault Ste. Marie, hosting a series of notable visitors in the 19th Century and is now a museum of the local and northern fur trade. Built of rough-cut fieldstone, the house is a good example of vernacular Georgian architecture.
