# Buchan House

The Buchan House, named after the family that owned it for many years, is the remains of a settler's log cabin. Built in the latter part of the nineteenth century, it is an example of traditional early Canadian timber construction. The Buchan House is the only known locally surviving hand-hewn, square-log building in Sault Ste. Marie. Originally situated on Carpin Beach Road, the house was moved to its present site in 1990 to save it from demolition.
