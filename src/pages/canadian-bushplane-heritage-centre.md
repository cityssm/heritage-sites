# Canadian Bushplane Heritage Centre

The two hangars were built in 1924-1925 and 1947 to serve as maintenance locations for the bush planes of the Ontario Provincial Air Service. Methods of suppressing forest fires were developed and tested here. The 1924 hangar pioneered the use of wide spans for hangar construction. The 1947 hangar is now the home of the Canadian Bushplane Heritage Centre.
