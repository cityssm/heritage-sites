The building is a traditional American Foursquare single-family residence, constructed 1903-1904 by Albert H. Mahon. The building is approximately 2 1/2 storeys tall and has four dormer windows at the top of the building's roof each on each face of the roof. The foundation is made from local sandstone excavated during the construction of the Sault Canal and the house exterior is constructed of decorative molded concrete blocks. The property has not undergone significant modifications, retaining the large open porch across the front and most of the original stained-glass windows. However, the rear porch has been extended and modernized over the years and a fire escape has been added to the building's second storey.
