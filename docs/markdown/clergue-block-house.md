![Clergue Block House](images/clergue-block-house.jpg)

Next door to the Old Stone House is the Clergue Blockhouse. Built in 1819, its fieldstone lower floor is the remains of the powder magazine of the North West Fur Co. fort. The log second storey, added at the end of the 19th Century, was a home of pioneer industrialist Francis Hector Clergue. The Blockhouse was moved to its current site in 1996 to save it from demolition.
