# 794 - 796 Queen Street East

Built before 1914 and known as the Best Block, this building was built as a hall (upstairs). There were many different stores that occupied the two main floor locations over the years with the Hussey-Ferrier Meat Co. and White Drug Store as long-term businesses. The building has been modernized. The upper floor decorative brickwork remains. The building does stand out in this block.
