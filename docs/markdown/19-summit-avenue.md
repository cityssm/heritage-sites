# 19 Summit Avenue

Built in 1911, the building has a sandstone foundation and a brick exterior. The south facing first floor extension appears to have been added at a later date with different colored brickwork. There is a pretty stone bridge and extended driveway. The heavily forested south side of the property extends to Ontario Avenue.

This is one of five homes on this end of Summit Avenue occupied by executives of the Algoma Central & Hudsonâ€™s Bay Co. Railway. The original occupant was CHC Jones, manager operations Spanish River Pulp and Paper Mills Lake Superior Paper Co. Ltd.
