# 107 Huron Street (Yard Locker and Board Mill)

Built in 1895 these buildings at the site of the former Sault Ste. Marie Pulp and Paper Company share the same design as the rest of the paper mill buildings built by Mr. F. H. Clergue. All are made of local sandstone. These buildings both have value in terms of their unique architecture and as a landmark representing Sault Ste. Marie's early industrial growth.
