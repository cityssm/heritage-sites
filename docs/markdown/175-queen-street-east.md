# 175 Queen Street East (King's Apartments)

Constructed in 1914 as the King's Theatre (later Griffin Theatre), this building consists of brick (since painted) with plain metal framing. The theatre became vacant in 1926. In 1930, Central Motors, an auto company had set up shop.

By 1934, the King's Apartments were located at the same address and the store was vacant. The left side has been clad with metal siding and it has the original windows, however the lower floor has been redesigned.
