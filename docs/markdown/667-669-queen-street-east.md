# 667 - 669 Queen Street East

Built in 1896 from local sandstone, its initial use was as a furniture store but soon became the M. J. Mahon funeral home which remained in business until 1948. The building is noted to have significant sandstone blocks on either side and the 2nd floor window above the side entrance still has its original wood frame. It blends in well and thus is not prominent in the block.
