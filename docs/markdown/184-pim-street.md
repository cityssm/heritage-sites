# 184 Pim Street (Marshall Apartments)

The building at the southeast corner of Pim and Wellington dates from 1901 or earlier. It was built with plain bricks and a sandstone foundation. The building has a large porch that is original and features wood windows.

The building was home to A. C. Boyce, the first M.P. of Algoma West (Sault Ste. Marie’s federal riding prior to 1966) from 1905 – 1917.

In the 1891 census, the residents may have been Robert Stark, a shoemaker, his wife Annie, and six children, aged between 1 and 17. In the 1901 City Directory (the first), this family is listed at this address.

The building was divided into multiple units in 1939-40, and was named Marshall Apartments in the 1944 City Directory. Sheriff George Lee was one of the first tenants.
