# 188 Church Street

Built before 1914 from sandstone with cedar shakes and pillars. The current pillars may be replacements, with exception of the sandstone sections. The original porch is still in place with a vinyl covering and the foundation is still original with ventilation. Windows are aluminum, except the foyer. The basement windows are original as with all of the sandstone sills. While the building has been altered, it still retains its value as a prominent historic sandstone structure.

Residence of Benjamin Cohen, Manager Algoma Iron Metal Co. from 1902 â€“ 1936.
