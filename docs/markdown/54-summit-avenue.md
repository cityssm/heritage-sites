# 54 Summit Avenue

![54 Summit Avenue](images/54-summit-avenue.png)

This beautiful home has been in the same family for 3 generations and its original beauty has been conscientiously preserved. The red oak beams, windows, baseboards & trim, built-in features such as 'the breakfast nook', library and cupboards have never been painted & glow with age (all casement windows are original & throughout the house). It is solidly built and has been lovingly maintained for 94 years. 'The Gables' has been used in architecture textbooks as an example of Tudor half-timbered style, used by architects of 'The Arts & Crafts' school (ex. Frank Lloyd Wright). The bricks used (Canadian 'bark' brick) were typical of the era and the foundation was erected with the distinct pink Jacobsville sandstone dredged from the Sault Canal. The Gables was built on a double corner lot at a time when several homes were built in the Summit Avenue district by other Algoma Steel executives. Other unique features of the property include a circular driveway in the back of the property to deliver coal.
