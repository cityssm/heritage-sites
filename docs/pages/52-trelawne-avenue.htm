<h1>52 Trelawne Avenue (16 Rosedale Place)</h1>
<p>This stately home was built of local sandstone around 1908, and is located halfway down the side of the hill between downtown and uptown. Occupied by A. L. Virene, Chemist at Algoma Steel, from 1912 to 1914. The building itself is 2.5 storeys with a 2 storey wooden porch. Windows are aluminum but replace the original wood ones in the same configuration, otherwise the building has not been altered. The original address was on Trelawne Avenue but by 1920 the address and access has been from Rosedale Avenue.</p>
