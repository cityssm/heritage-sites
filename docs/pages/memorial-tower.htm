<p>The Memorial Tower was part of the Memorial Gardens, built in 1949 and demolished in 2005 to make way for the Essar Centre. The Tower commemorated those who died in the World and Korean Wars, whose names, together with those from the war in Afghanistan, are now recorded in the Essar Centre. With its streamlined form and its use of concrete and glass blocks, the Tower is an example of the Moderne Style. The cupola on top is a reminder of the eternal flame that marks the grave of the Unknown Soldier.</p>
