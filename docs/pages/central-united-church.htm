<p>The church was originally designed by Toronto architect Henry Simpson, and built over the period from 1900-1911. As are many local buildings of the period, it is constructed of sandstone derived from local sources. This unique building, with its massive bell tower and its circular sanctuary, reminds us of the buildingâ€™s Methodist roots.</p>
