<p>The building itself was believed to have been constructed in 1928 of stucco and brick and was constructed in a Tudor style. The building is on 6.83 acres.</p>
<p>The first resident was George R. Gray, Director Abitibi Power and Paper Company Ltd. The house was called Cedarhurst.</p>
<p>Although there is no indication in the city directory that Sir James Dunn lived in this building, there is a record of the home being used as the Sir James Dunn Convalescent Home in 1945, while the city directory lists this building as &quot;vacant&quot;. Between 1944-1948 Dunn was residing at 13 Summit Ave, according to the city directory listing.</p>
<p>In 1950, the property was transferred by Sir James Dunn to the Sisters of St. Joseph, with the provision that they use the building as a regional house for Sisters, and a school for girls. The building was to be called &quot;Mount St. Joseph&quot;. His gift was an acknowledgement of the care he had received from the Sisters while in hospital.</p>
<p>Mount St. Joseph College for Girls was opened in 1959, on land adjacent to Mount St. Joseph Convent.</p>
