<h1 id="dawson-block">Dawson Block</h1>
<p>The Dawson Block was constructed in 1898 from local sandstone quarried during the excavation of the Sault lock. As the location of the Dawson &amp; Co. grocery store, it is linked to the commercial history of the city. The original third floor was destroyed by fire in 1953.</p>
