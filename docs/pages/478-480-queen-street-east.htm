<p>This building was constructed before 1901 as the Farwell Block and its primary building material is sandstone. The design of the building itself is interesting with banding patterns in the sandstone, with selected lintel sandstone stones, and has a metal cornice and wooden gable ends. Although the ground floor has been modernized the second floor and the exterior walls retain the original character.</p>
<p>The building has been prominent on Queen Street for 120 years. The first major occupant was Northern Hardware Co., later to become the Plummer-Ferguson Hardware Co. One side of the building was rented out to many different businesses. By 1920, Prudential Insurance and Leader Department Store were occupants and it was called the Leader Block. Several businesses have since been tenants.</p>
