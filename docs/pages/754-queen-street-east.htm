<h1>754 Queen Street East</h1>
<p>Originally known as the Tischart Block, this building constructed in 1902, initially housed the Tischart Hardware Co., later Pickford Hardware. Later still, Smit Wallpaper and Painter’s Supplies occupied the main floor followed by Edwards Paint &amp; Wallpaper. The brickwork is decorative and the building has retained the arched wood windows on the upper floor. The lower level has been modified with new brickwork and stonework, which was completed in a sympathetic way to the building’s original architecture. The building stands out on the block.</p>
