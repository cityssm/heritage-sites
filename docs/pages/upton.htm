<p>Built in 1865, &quot;Upton&quot; is one of the city’s oldest residential buildings. It was the home of Wemyss Simpson, last Chief Factor of the Hudson’s Bay Company in the Sault and the first Member of Parliament for the District of Algoma. It is an excellent example of the Georgian style of architecture.</p>
