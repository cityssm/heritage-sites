<p>The Cathedral, the oldest surviving church in the city, built in 1876 to replace a wooden church nearby, consisted originally of the present narthex, nave and tower. Transepts, designed by H. Russell Halton who designed the Coronation and Hussey further west on Queen Street, were added in 1901.</p>
