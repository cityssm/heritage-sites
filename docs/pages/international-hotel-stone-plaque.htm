<p>This plaque represents the International Hotel which was completed in 1888. The 225 room International Hotel reflected the growth of the young town of Sault Ste. Marie which had been spurred by the coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway and the construction of the International Railway Bridge in 1867. Close to St. Mary’s River, the major transportation route, the hotel had its’ own wharf for tourist vessels and excellent fishing outside the hotel doors. The International Hotel was completely destroyed on January 10, 1916 by a fire. Today only the cornerpost of the stone wall which surrounded the hotel remains.</p>
