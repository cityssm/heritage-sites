<h1>130 John Street (Church) and 136 John Street (Hall)</h1>
<p>130 John Street – former St. John the Evangelist Anglican Church</p>
<p>136 John Street – former St. John&#39;s Memorial Hall</p>
<p>The Church was built in 1957 and the Hall was built before 1914. The Church is built of 1950s brick and is a neighbourhood landmark.</p>
<p>The Hall was constructed of local sandstone and construction exemplifies a high degree of craftsmanship and detail. The Hall has also been largely unaltered and stands out as a local landmark.</p>
<p>The properties at 134, 136 and 138 John Street were returned to the Métis Nation of Ontario in 2017 by the Anglican Church of Canada who had owned the properties since 1901.</p>
<p>The three buildings were constructed on a burial ground used originally by local Métis and later by the North West Company&#39;s fur-trading fort.</p>
