<p>This beautiful home has been in the same family for 3 generations and its original beauty has been conscientiously preserved. The red oak beams, windows, baseboards &amp; trim, built-in features such as &#39;the breakfast nook&#39;, library and cupboards have never been painted &amp; glow with age (all casement windows are original &amp; throughout the house). It is solidly built and has been lovingly maintained for 94 years. &#39;The Gables&#39; has been used in architecture textbooks as an example of Tudor half-timbered style, used by architects of &#39;The Arts &amp; Crafts&#39; school (ex. Frank Lloyd Wright). The bricks used (Canadian &#39;bark&#39; brick) were typical of the era and the foundation was erected with the distinct pink Jacobsville sandstone dredged from the Sault Canal. The Gables was built on a double corner lot at a time when several homes were built in the Summit Avenue district by other Algoma Steel executives. Other unique features of the property include a circular driveway in the back of the property to deliver coal.</p>
