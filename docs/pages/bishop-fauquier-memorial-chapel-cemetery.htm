<h1 id="bishop-fauquier-memorial-chapel--cemetery">Bishop Fauquier Memorial Chapel &amp; Cemetery</h1>
<p>The Chapel was built in 1883 and is the only surviving building of the Shingwauk School, an Indian residential school operated by the Anglican Church. Its design is typical Gothic Revival and elements such as the Tudor half-timbering reflect its English origins. The Memorial Chapel Cemetery is located behind the Chapel.</p>
