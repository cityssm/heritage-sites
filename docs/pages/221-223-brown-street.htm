<h1>221 - 223 Brown Street</h1>
<p>Built in 1913 using fancy concrete blocks by Chandler Baldwin. W. W. Baldwin Block Works is believed to be the manufacturer of the blocks. This building is believed to be the oldest apartment building in Sault Ste. Marie. The building itself was modeled after southern-style buildings, and the concrete blocks that make it up have a variety of designs and patterns. The front fa√ßade of the building consists of an overhanging roof above the 2nd floor supported by three original wooden columns made from wooden boards about six meters long. Large verandas extend out on both the 1st and 2nd floors.</p>
<p>This building has also been home to several important people such as the Browns, who developed the original subdivision and are the namesake of the street and S. F. Howe, a school principal lived there from 1917-1918.</p>
