<h1>484 - 488 Queen Street East (Taylor Block)</h1>
<p>This building was constructed between 1903 and 1904 and made from decorative brick. The ground floor has been mostly modernized though the upper two floors are still retain the original brick detail and windows. It has been noted as unusual for its height (three stories) as this is uncommon for buildings of its age on Queen St.</p>
<p>Upon completion, the building housed the Julian Taylor Stationary and a clothing store on the ground floor. The short-lived Soo Business College occupied much of the third floor with J.A. Furse as principal. Norman Bethune who became the famous Canadian doctor in China was believed to have attended classes here. By 1910, Taylor Books and Prudential Insurance took up the main floor. In 1920, the English and Scotch woolen company had its store here. More recently and fruit market and Con-ell Furs had set up shop with apartments on the second and third floors.</p>
