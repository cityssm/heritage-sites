<h1>184 Pim Street (Marshall Apartments)</h1>
<p>The building at the southeast corner of Pim and Wellington dates from 1901 or earlier. It was built with plain bricks and a sandstone foundation. The building has a large porch that is original and features wood windows.</p>
<p>The building was home to A. C. Boyce, the first M.P. of Algoma West (Sault Ste. Marie’s federal riding prior to 1966) from 1905 – 1917.</p>
<p>In the 1891 census, the residents may have been Robert Stark, a shoemaker, his wife Annie, and six children, aged between 1 and 17. In the 1901 City Directory (the first), this family is listed at this address.</p>
<p>The building was divided into multiple units in 1939-40, and was named Marshall Apartments in the 1944 City Directory. Sheriff George Lee was one of the first tenants.</p>
